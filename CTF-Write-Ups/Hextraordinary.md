## ROXy’s Codes
These are the two codes ROXy sent us, which we think can be combined in some way to generate a secret code. See what you do with it. We believe the code should start with the same 0x prefix.
      
      0xB105F00D
  
      0xAAA8400A

## Performance

Convert the hexadecimal values to binary

      0xB105F00D in binary is 10110001000001011111000000001101.
      
      0xAAA8400A in binary is 10101010101010000100000000001010.

Perform the XOR operation bit by bit:

      10110001000001011111000000001101 XOR 10101010101010000100000000001010

      Result: 00011011101011011011000000000111

Convert the binary result back to hexadecimal with the 0x prefix:

      00011011101011011011000000000111 in hexadecimal is 1BADB007
      
The secret code starts with 0x and is obtained by XORing 0xB105F00D and 0xAAA8400A is 0x1BADB007.

      Flag: 0x1BADB007
