## Why is it important?
- Exploit code is usually written in C (extension .c), but a computer cannot directly understand C.
- Exploit code is not executable => Compiling turns it into a real program (machine code) that the computer can actually execute.
- Conclusion: It compiles exploit.c into a runnable program called exploit. Without compiling, an exploit is just instructions, not something the system can run.

## Why do I need it?
- Privilege escalation purposes.

## How do I use it?

    gcc exploit.c -o exploit

gcc = the compiler for C programs.

exploit.c = the source code file I want to compile.

-o exploit = output the compiled program with the name exploit.
