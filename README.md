# OverTheWire Writeup

I took on Bandit from OverTheWire to solidify my Linux fundamentals. The mission is simple: find the password for the next level using logic, observation, and the right tools.

Some challenges were quick wins, and others made me slow down, dig deeper, and pick up new skills along the way. It wasn’t always easy, but each level felt like real progress.

This writeup captures the lessons, mistakes, and small victories from my journey. It's not only my personal record, but also a guide for anyone starting their own.

## Please note
During my writeup, I’ve used “…” to replace lengthy sections of output, keeping the examples concise and easy to follow.
